# AR.js simple web app

Display videos over still images in AR using AR.js through a simple web app deployed with github pages. 

Should take into consideration the limitations of github pages (no cross origin fetching, etc.) and keep it as simple as possible.

Where I left:

- I managed to display the video, but it was choppy.
    - Maybe I should try to downsize it a little bit, check the other video from the example.
- Play around with the sizes and displays as well.
- Try to deploy it locally to avoid having to commit and push all of the time.
- Try some real examples that I'll be using.
